Since my last blog entry, some time has passed, which is why I wanted to dedicate myself to my hobby again.
I had actually planned to write something about Pi-Hole and Unbound, but I noticed that there is a new major version of the [Tailwind-NextJS-Starter-Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
So, it's time to do some housekeeping first before moving on to new content topics.

Some of the new features in version 2.0.0 include:

- Update to Next 13
- New search feature that supports local search with kbar and algolia
- Updated analytics config
- Styling Updates

For an overview of all changes, please refer to the release blog entry on "[Tailwind-Blog](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/release-of-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog-v2.0)".
