tags: ['Python', 'Advent of code']
draft: false
summary: The Advent of code event has begun shortly and of course I participated again.

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an yearly recurring event which gives you 25 puzzles to solve in an programming language of your choice. Each day another puzzle is made available.

I decided to solve the puzzles in [Python](https://www.python.org/) again as I want to get more comfortable with Python and in comparision to TypeScript or Java there is less overhead in setting up the development environment.

I will publish my solutions in my GitHub repositoy. The solutions of the years before are also available.

- [Solutions for 2023](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2023) on GitHub in Python
- [Solutions for 2022](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2022) on GitHub in TypeScript
- [Solutions for 2021](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2021) on GitHub in Python
- [Solutions for 2020](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2020) on GitHub in Java

Happy coding everyone!
