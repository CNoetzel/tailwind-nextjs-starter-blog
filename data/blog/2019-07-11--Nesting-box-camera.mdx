## Preface

The nesting box was originally put into operation with a **Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2.0 (700 MHz, 512 MB)**.
Since the recordings were a bit jerky and not the best quality, I decided to buy new hardware for the nesting box. At the same time, I also documented the facility.

Now I am using a **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 (1200 MHz, 1GB)** with the [Kuman 5MP NightVision camera](http://www.kumantech.com/kuman-for-raspberry-pi-camera-module-5mp-1080p-ov5647-sensor-hd-video-webcam-night-vision-for-all-vision-raspberry-pi-model-b-b-a-rpi-3-2-1-sc15-1_p0432.html). The Raspberry Pi camera module can be put into operation as follows.

## Steps

### Activation of the camera interface

First the camera interface on the Raspberry Pi should be switched on.
This could be done by opening the configuration interface using `sudo raspi-config` and activating it under _5. Interface Options_ â†’ _P1 Camera_.

![raspi-config](/static/blog/2019-07-11-raspi-config.PNG 'raspi-config activating camera interface')

If not already done the camera can now be connected to the Pi using the FFC connection cable.
A first test can then be carried out to determine whether the camera has been connected correctly and is working.

```bash
 raspistill -o test.jpg
```

The command should take a picture and place it in the current folder.

### Load camera driver

Motion requires a device that works with the V4L / Video4Linux driver. Therefore module `bcm2835-v4l2` has to be loaded.
To do this automatically on system start-up two entries are added to the file `/etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf`.

```bash
# camera with v4l2 driver
v4l2_common
bcm2835-v4l2
```

After reboot the command `ls -l /dev/video*` should list the video device `/dev/video0`.

### Install Motion

Nex step is installing [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io).

```bash
sudo apt-get install motion
```

    },
  ]}
/>

### Configuration of motion

Motion is controlled via a configuration file that can be found under `/etc/motion/motion.conf`. In the following, I will briefly discuss the most important changes that I have made to my configuration.
The complete documentation for the configuration can be found [here](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html).

| Parameter             | Wert              | Funktion                                                                                                                                                 |

| threshold             | 50000             | Number of pixels that have to change to be recognized as movement. I have chosen a relatively large value here because the monitored area is very small. |
| minimum_motion_frames | 5                 | Number of consecutive frames that must contain motion before motion detection is triggered.                                                              |
| output_pictures       | center            | Images should be saved when movement is detected, namely when the movement is as close as possible to the center of the image.                           |
| quality               | 100               | Quality of the JPEG / WEBP compression.                                                                                                                  |
| text_right            | %d.%m.%Y\n%T      | The date in DMY format should be displayed at the bottom right.                                                                                          |
| text_left             | Nistkasten        | The text "Nesting Box" appears at the bottom left.                                                                                                       |
| target_dir            | /home/xxx/Monitor | Folder under which the images are to be stored.                                                                                                          |
| stream_localhost      | off               | Enable access the to live stream from other computers.                                                                                                   |
| stream_maxrate        | 30                | Maximum refresh rate of the live stream.                                                                                                                 |

After changes to the configuration Motion is restarted by `sudo service motion restart`.

If the standard port 8081 has been retained, the live stream can then be accessed with a browser via the IP or the host name of the Pi, e.g. `http://hostname-of-the-pi:8081/`.

### Starting Motion daemon

Since the first option stipulated that Motion can be started as daemon we have to ensure that this happens every time the system is started.
Therefore the file `/etc/default/motion` is adapted and the value is set to `yes`.

```bash
# set to 'yes' to enable the motion daemon
start_motion_daemon=yes
```

### Finshed

That's it! The camera should now record everything and store pictures in the configured folder if motion has been detected.
