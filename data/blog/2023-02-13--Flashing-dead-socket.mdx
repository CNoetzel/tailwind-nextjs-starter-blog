summary: I successfully flashed the Dead Socket with Tasmota.
---

I did succeed getting the last socket running which was unreachable before as mentioned in my [last blog article](https://www.divisionby0.de/blog/2023-02-12--Gosund-EP2-Tasmota-flash). ðŸ¥³

The socket wasn't reachable during flash (see console output below), but its MAC address was present when inspecting the `smarthack-wifi.log` in `scripts`-folder.

Ready to flash third party firmware!

For your convenience, the following firmware images are already included in this repository:
  Tasmota v8.1.0.2 (wifiman)
  ESPurna 1.13.5 (base)

You can also provide your own image by placing it in the /files directory
Please ensure the firmware fits the device and includes the bootloader
MAXIMUM SIZE IS 512KB

Available options:
  0) return to stock
  1) flash espurna.bin
  2) flash tasmota.bin
  q) quit; do nothing
Please select 0-2: 2
Are you sure you want to flash tasmota.bin? This is the point of no return [y/N] y
Attempting to flash tasmota.bin, this may take a few seconds...
Could not reach the device!
```

All I had to do was start pining the device with `ping 10.42.42.42`, removing the socket from my wall plug and then putting it back in.
The ping command should reach the device again and generate output.
After doing this I was able to flash the socket successfully with Tasmota.

Tyua-convert issue [Socket won't flash #613](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/613) on GitHub helped my solving this problem.
