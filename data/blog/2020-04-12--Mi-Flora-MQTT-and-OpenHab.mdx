## Preface

When we moved into our house two years ago, we used two old flower boxes from the previous owner to grow herbs and tomatoes on our terrace.
In course of the warm summer however, it turned out that the watering of the small boxes is very laborious and has to be done several times a day.

That's why we built a flower bed of three mortar boxes for our plants during winter. To make irrigation easier we decided to put a pressureless bead hose in the boxes and connect it to our rain barrel.
A manually operated valve is used to start and stop irrigation and there is no need to drag watering cans anymore.

I would like to automate the watering process itself so that you have the option of being absent for longer even during the growing season.
An irrigation computer could help, but they often irrigate at set intervals and not on demand.
In spring, when the temperatures are still moderate and the plants are small they need less water than the full-grown plants with fruits in summer.

For this reason I decided to equip the boxes with sensors in the first step to determine the need.
I came across the [Mi-Flora plant sensors from Xiaomi](https://www.mein-gartenexperte.de/xiaomi-mi-plant-flower-care-test), which are able to measure also the light irradiation, temperature, fertility of the soil in addition to the soil moisture.

This data is send to OpenHab which could control watering.

## Technical Overview

![tech-diagram](/static/blog/2020-04-12-tech-diagram.png 'technical diagram of components for measuring soil moisture')

The Mi Flora plant sensors are equipped with Bluetooth 4.1 LE chips for which reason the sending range is relatively small.
The Raspberry Pi which runs with Openhab on the first floor is not able to establish a stable connection to the sensors through the outer wall.
For this reason I have installed a Raspberry Pi Zero on the ground floor near the terrace which establishes a Bluetooth connection to the sensors and sends the measured values ​​via MQTT
to the MQTT broker (here [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) on the first floor.
OpenHab is able to display the measured values ​​in the user interface by using the corresponding binding.

For the communication between the plant sensors and MQTT the [miflora-mqtt-daemon](https://github.com/ThomDietrich/miflora-mqtt-daemon) from ThomDietrich is in use.

## Step 1: MQTT Broker

### Installation of [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/)

If there is no MQTT broker such as [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) from Eclipse in the network yet, the first step is to set up one.
The main task of the MQTT Broker is to receive all messages on certain topics, to decide who is interested in these messages and to forward them to the interested parties (see [Publish – subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)).

In my case the MQTT broker is installed on the Pi, which is also running OpenHab. The following commands will install Mosquitto.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

In order for Mosquitto to run automatically when the system starts, the Mosquitto unit file must be activated via `systemctl`.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service
```

<NoticeBox
  type="info"
  heading="Hint"
  content={[
    {
      text: 'The installation can be checked with <i>mosquitto -v</i>.',
    },
    {
      text: 'The "Error: Address already in use" error can be ignored because it only states that the broker is already active.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Configuration

By default every client can send messages to the broker.
Therefore it is advisable to create users who have to authenticate themselves with a password in order to be able to send messages.

Two users are created in my case. One for the Pi which communicates with the plant sensors and one for OpenHab.

The first command creates the `passwd` file under`/etc/mosquitto` and creates the user _openhab_.
The second command adds the user _miflora_ to the file with the password being given directly.
The passwords are automatically encrypted and saved in the file.

```bash
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd openhab
sudo mosquitto_passwd -b /etc/mosquitto/passwd miflora <password>
```

![create-users](/static/blog/2020-04-12-create-users.png 'create mqtt users')

To disallow unauthenticated communication another configuration file must be created using `sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf`.

This file has the following content:

```
allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
```

Finally the service has to be restarted with `sudo systemctl restart mosquitto`.

### Testing the Broker

The MQTT broker can be easily tested by opening two terminals. In one terminal you register as a subscriber for a certain topic using `mosquitto_sub` (in this case _test_).

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u openhab -P <password>
```

In the second terminal you send a message to the topic using `mosquitto_pub`.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test" -m "Hello World!" -u miflora -P <password>
```

If everything is configured correctly you should see the message in the first terminal.
In addition you should no longer be able to send messages to a topic if no user is specified.

## Step 2: Setting up the BT-MQTT bridge

In the second step the [miflora-mqqt-daemon](https://github.com/ThomDietrich/miflora-mqtt-daemon) by ThomDietrich is installed on a RasperryPi.
The Pi is used to connect to the plant sensors via Bluetooth, pick up the data and send it to the OpenHab Pi via MQTT.
Due to the short transmission distance of the plant sensors, the Pi should be positioned as close as possible to them.

The following installation is also described on the GitHub project page from ThomDietrich.

### Installation [miflora-mqtt-daemon](https://github.com/ThomDietrich/miflora-mqtt-daemon)

The starting point is a freshly set up and configured RaspberryPi Zero.

First some necessarry packages are installed. Afterwards the project is cloned to `/opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon` and installed likewise.

```bash
sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip bluetooth bluez

sudo git clone https://github.com/ThomDietrich/miflora-mqtt-daemon.git /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon

cd /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

In order for the MQTT daemon to run automatically with every system start, the unit file of the miflora service must be copied and activated.

```bash
sudo cp /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon/template.service /etc/systemd/system/miflora.service
sudo systemctl enable miflora.service
sudo systemctl start miflora.service
```

### Register the sensors

Personal settings regarding the sensors are entered in the `config.ini`.
This file must be generated by making a copy of the `config.ini.dist`.

```bash
sudo cp /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon/config.{ini.dist,ini}
```

Next step is to scan for available devices using `sudo hcitool lescan`.
The output should look like this and the sensors should appear as a **Flower care** device in the list.

![hci-tool-output](/static/blog/2020-04-12-output-hcitool.png 'output of device scan')

The displayed MAC address is entered in the `config.ini` in the `[Sensors]` section.
Since I own two sensors I have created two entries.

```bash
sudo nano /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon/config.ini
```

```
[Sensors]
Herbs@Terrace    = C4:7C:8D:xx:xx:xx
Tomatoes@Terrace = C4:7C:8D:xx:xx:xx
```

### Setting up the MQTT broker

Connection data for the MQTT broker, which was installed in step 1 has to be configured in the `config.ini` under the section `[MQTT]`.

```
[MQTT]
hostname = <Host name of the device on which Mosquitto is running>
base_topic = miflora
username = miflora
password = <password>
```

Once the data has been stored the daemon can be executed using `python3 /opt/miflora-mqtt-daemon/miflora-mqtt-daemon.py`.
Now you should be able to see that the plant sensors are queried and the values ​​are sent to MQTT topics.

![sensor-output](/static/blog/2020-04-12-output-sensors.png 'output of plant sensors')

<NoticeBox
  type="info"
  heading="Hint"
  content={[
    {
      text: 'If you notice an error message regarding the firmware version of the sensor (as shown in the picture) this must be updated via the <b>FlowerCare</b> app.',
    },
    {
      text: 'The app is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flower-care/id1095274672" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="hhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huahuacaocao.flowercare&hl=de" target="_blank">Android</a>.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Step 3: Display data in OpenHab

In order to display data in OpenHab the [MQTT binding](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/mqtt/) must be installed via paper UI.
Since the data is transmitted in JSON format and individual values should be extracted from it, the [JSONPath Transformation](https://www.openhab.org/addons/transformations/jsonpath/) under "Add-ons &#x2192; Transformations" can be added.

If all preparations have been made, the things for OpenHab can be created. The broker and the topics are configured in these.
Created a file with `sudo nano /etc/openhab2/things/mqtt.things` and provide the following content.

```
Bridge mqtt:broker:mosquitto "MQTT Broker"
[
    host="localhost",
    port=1883,
    secure=false,
    username="openhab",
    password=<password>
]

Thing mqtt:topic:herbs "Herbs" (mqtt:broker:mosquitto) {
    Channels:
        Type number : light         "Light intensity"      [ stateTopic="miflora/Herbs", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.light" ]
        Type number : battery       "Battery charge"       [ stateTopic="miflora/Herbs", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.battery" ]
        Type number : temperature   "Temperature"          [ stateTopic="miflora/Herbs", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.temperature" ]
        Type number : conductivity  "Fertility"            [ stateTopic="miflora/Herbs", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.conductivity" ]
        Type number : moisture      "Moisture"             [ stateTopic="miflora/Herbs", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.moisture" ]
}

Thing mqtt:topic:tomatoes "Tomatoes" (mqtt:broker:mosquitto) {
    Channels:
        Type number : light         "Light intensity"      [ stateTopic="miflora/Tomatoes", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.light" ]
        Type number : battery       "Battery charge"       [ stateTopic="miflora/Tomatoes", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.battery" ]
        Type number : temperature   "Temperature"          [ stateTopic="miflora/Tomatoes", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.temperature" ]
        Type number : conductivity  "Fertility"            [ stateTopic="miflora/Tomatoes", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.conductivity" ]
        Type number : moisture      "Moisture"             [ stateTopic="miflora/Tomatoes", transformationPattern="JSONPATH:$.moisture" ]
}
```

The first lines create a broker and configure the connection. After that the channels for the two sensors that are listening to different topics
and extract the values ​​from the JSON using the `JSONPATH` transformation are configured.

For displaying data in Openhab items are required. The file is created via `sudo nano /etc/openhab2/items/miflora.items` and has the following content.

```
Group gHerbs
Number:Illuminance      Miflora_Herbs_Light             "Light intensity [%d lx]"   <light>         (gHerbs) { channel="mqtt:topic:herbs:light" }
Number:Dimensionless    Miflora_Herbs_Battery           "Battery charg [%d %%]"     <battery>       (gHerbs) { channel="mqtt:topic:herbs:battery" }
Number:Temperature      Miflora_Herbs_Temperature       "Temperature [%.1f °C]"     <temperature>   (gHerbs) { channel="mqtt:topic:herbs:temperature" }
Number                  Miflora_Herbs_Conductivity      "Fertility [%d µS/cm]"      <lawnmower>     (gHerbs) { channel="mqtt:topic:herbs:conductivity" }
Number:Dimensionless    Miflora_Herbs_Moisture          "Moisture [%d %%]"          <humidity>      (gHerbs) { channel="mqtt:topic:herbs:moisture" }

Group gTomatoes
Number:Illuminance      Miflora_Tomatoes_Light         "Light intensity [%d lx]"    <light>         (gTomatoes) { channel="mqtt:topic:tomatoes:light" }
Number:Dimensionless    Miflora_Tomatoes_Battery       "Battery charg [%d %%]"      <battery>       (gTomatoes) { channel="mqtt:topic:tomatoes:battery" }
Number:Temperature      Miflora_Tomatoes_Temperature   "Temperature [%.1f °C]"      <temperature>   (gTomatoes) { channel="mqtt:topic:tomatoes:temperature" }
Number                  Miflora_Tomatoes_Conductivity  "Fertility [%d µS/cm]"       <lawnmower>     (gTomatoes) { channel="mqtt:topic:tomatoes:conductivity" }
Number:Dimensionless    Miflora_Tomatoes_Moisture      "Moisture [%d %%]"           <humidity>      (gTomatoes) { channel="mqtt:topic:tomatoes:moisture" }
```

Representation of individual values ​​can be determined here. Data basis are the values from the channels that were previously created in the Things files.

The following content can be added to the `default.sitemap` for displaying values.

```
  Frame label="Plantsensors" {
    Group   item=gHerbs     icon="herbs"    label="Herbs"
    Group   item=gTomatoes  icon="tomato"   label="Tomatoes"
  }
```

The OpenHab configuration is now complete and the values ​​should be accessible via sitemap.

As you can see it was a sunny Easter Sunday 2020 😉

## Conclusion

With little effort it is possible to access values from the sensors and display them in OpenHab.
This is the first step towards automated irrigation. If you want you can also use OpenHab to
persist the collected data and create a dashboard in Grafana.

An example is the [conference plant](https://www.unixe.de/die-konferenzpflanze/) by Marianne, whose article also inspired me to implement this project.

With such a dashboard you can see both the current and the historical data. This helps to check that there is enough watering and that the watering is even enough.
