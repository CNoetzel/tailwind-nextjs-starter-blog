summary: The Advent of code event has begun shortly time to enhance my TypeScript skills by solving the puzzles.

In this years [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) I'm using TypeScript to solve the puzzles. Compared to last years Python challenge it took me some more to time setup up my development environment. On the other hand I'm used to work with Typescript and strong typed languages so solving the puzzles is a little bit easier with a more or less well known language.

I will publish my solution in my GitHub repositoy with at least one day delay. The solutions from 2020 and 2021 implemented in Java and Python are also available.

- [Solutions for 2022](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2022) on GitHub in TypeScript
- [Solutions for 2021](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2021) on GitHub in Python
- [Solutions for 2020](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2020) on GitHub in Java

The last two years I solved the this first nine days. Hopefully I'm doing better this year but already three days behind ðŸ˜±

Happy coding everyone!
