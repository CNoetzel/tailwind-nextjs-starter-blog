[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an yearly recurring event which gives you 25 puzzles to solve in an programming language of your choice. Each day another puzzle is made available.

This year my girlfriend joined me in solving the puzzles.
Different to the year before I decided to progamming in [Python](https://www.python.org/) as I haven't used this langunge before and we both wanted to start at the same level.

I will publish my solution in my GitHub repositoy with at least one day delay. The solutions from 2020 implemented in Java are also available.

- [Solutions for 2021](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2021) on GitHub in Python
- [Solutions for 2020](https://github.com/CNoetzel/AdventOfCode2020) on GitHub in Java

Last year I made it to day nine, hopefully I will keep up longer this year ðŸ˜ƒ

Happy coding everyone!
