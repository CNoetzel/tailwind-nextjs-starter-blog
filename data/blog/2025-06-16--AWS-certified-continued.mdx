As already mentioned in the blog article regarding my [cloud practitioner certification](https://www.divisionby0.de/blog/2022-06-06--AWS-certified), I waited a bit and finally tackled the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 certification.

This time, I took a bit more time to study and prepared again with the Udemy course "[Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2025

Afterwards, I completed the [six practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/share/102Yz63@cxTEpZKh6BwMSHthwRUIfevei2hm9bHBK4ouR-dphp8n76ODc15hyP0_B0HBuwOw/) multiple times and felt reasonably prepared for the exam.

The exam was somewhat more difficult than the one for the Cloud Practitioner, but I was still able to successfully pass it yesterday with a score of 878 out of 1000 points 🥳
